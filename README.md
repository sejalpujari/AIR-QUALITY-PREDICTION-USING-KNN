Air Quality Prediction Using KNN
This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It utilizes environmental factors like Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and Particulate Matter (PM) to predict the AQI and categorize the air quality. The model is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and a simple Tkinter GUI for user interaction.

Features
KNN-based Prediction: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for AQI prediction.
User-friendly Interface: A GUI developed using Tkinter where users can input pollutant levels.
Real-Time AQI Prediction: Predicts AQI based on user-provided pollutant data.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes performance evaluation with R-squared and RMSE values.
Visualization: Displays results using Matplotlib for model comparison.
Requirements
You need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
